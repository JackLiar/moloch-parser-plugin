# moloch-parser-plugin
An example project about how to implement parsers or plugins of Moloch (using CMake as makefile generator)

# Build

First, put all related dependencies source code archive files into `third_party` folder(I take hyperscan as an example here)

Then execute:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
